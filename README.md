# Loadshedding Notifier
### Backstory:

Hello World, my name is Gareth and I am 17 living in South Africa. In South Africa there is one major power company that powers the entire country that goes by the name of Eskom. Ever since 2014 they implemented "loadshedding" which according to wikipedia is defined as "load shedding is implemented whenever generating units are taken offline for maintenance, repairs or re-fueling (in the case of nuclear units)". This happens and still continues to happen to this day because Eskom is not capable of producing enough electricity for all of their customers and is forced to cut the power to certain areas according to a schecule when they anounce that loadshedding is active. The length of the power cuts are usually 2 hours long and the frequency per day depends on the level of loadshedding at that time.

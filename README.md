# Loadshedding Notifier
### Backstory:

Hello World, my name is Gareth and I am 17 living in South Africa. In South Africa there is one major power company that powers the entire country that goes by the name of **Eskom**. Ever since 2014 they implemented "loadshedding" which according to wikipedia is defined as "load shedding is implemented whenever generating units are taken offline for maintenance, repairs or re-fueling (in the case of nuclear units)". This happens and still continues to happen to this day because Eskom is not capable of producing enough electricity for all of their customers and is forced to cut the power to certain areas according to a schecule when they anounce that loadshedding is active. The length of the power cuts are usually 2 hours long and the frequency per day depends on the level of loadshedding at that time.

### Reasoning:

The reason I decided to make a form of audible notification was because there have been many times where I just haven't been by my phone to see the schedule or it is out of battery and I continue to use my devices as usual not knowing that Eskom has enounced that loadshedding it taking place soon. Unknowingly I continue to work or play and find myself caught in the dark losing all the data that I didn't save and worrying if the more fragile computers like the Rasperry Pi will even be able to boot again due to corruption. I knew I needed a final project so I decided to have the Pi run all time constantly checking and telling me when the powers about to go out.
